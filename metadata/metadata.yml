name: Learning spatiotemporal dynamics with a pretrained generative model
description: we propose a sparse-sensor-assisted score-based generative model (S3GM)
  to reconstruct full-field spatiotemporal dynamics based on sparse measurement. We
  use a dual-stage reconstruction pipeline, in which an unconditioned generative model
  is firstly pretrained capturing the joint distribution of a vast group of pretraining
  data in a self-supervised manner, followed then by a sampling process conditioned
  on unseen sparse measurement. The code contains the pertained model and the corresponding
  sampling process on the cases of Kolmogorov flow and cylinder flow.
